        <h2 class="title">Upright Women Wanted</h2>
        <h3 class="author">Sarah Gailey</h3>
        <p>Upright Women Wanted takes place in a near future America where society has deteriorated into something like the Old West. Everyone is expected to follow the norms of the state; any sign of resistance or deviance (such as possessing unapproved materials, sharing rations, or being LGBTQ) can get a person executed. When Esther is forced to watch her lover hang for possession of unapproved materials and later finds out that her father has arranged to marry her off to a man who was once engaged to her lover, she makes the decision to run away to join the Librarians. Librarians are responsible for traveling to different towns and outposts to deliver state approved materials. Being LGBTQ, Esther believes that there is something fundamentally wrong with her, and she blames herself for what happened to her lover. She figured that if she works with a group of upright women she can somehow cure herself of her wrongness (or at least keep it at bay). Esther soon finds out that the Librarians are not what they seem. The three Librarians she meets, a lesbian couple and a non-binary individual, are actively supporting the resistance by delivering supplies to resistance outposts and transporting runaways like Esther to safe-havens. Esther soon realizes that she is not wrong or broken, and that there are people out there like her, people that desperately need help, and that is worth fighting for.
        </p>
        <p>Upright Women Wanted was an interesting premise, but the plot felt a little thin to me. I think the story would have benefitted more as a full-length novel rather than a novella. I enjoyed watching Esther grow as a character, although there were some moments when she seemed so naive it was verging on irritating. The budding relationship between Esther and Cye (non-binary character) was very sweet, and the fight scenes between the Librarians and law enforcement officials were well written. Overall, the story was interesting, but I think the length left a lot of details about this dystopian society out.
