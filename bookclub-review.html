      <p>Don't let the title fool you, this is not just an adventurous romp about about a group of middle aged women overcoming impossible societal and supernatural odds. This is a story about a group women who, despite their upbringing, band together to do what's right not what's easy. Of course it has a dangerous vampire, but the real monster is the patriarchy. The story starts in a suburb in Charleston South Carolina, where Patricia Campbell, a woman who gave up her nursing career to become a housewife, and a group of other southern housewives get together to form a book club (or not a book club) to talk about true crime books. The meetings become Patricia's means of escape from her mundane life, and she forms close bonds with the members of her book club. One day, a mysterious man moves into the neighborhood. Patricia meets the new neighbor, and she cannot shake the feeling that something is very off about him. James Harris has no past, no personal ties, and seems to change his story whenever people ask him about his background. But the more the charismatic bachelor ingratiates himself with the rest of the neighborhood, the more everyone (particularly her husband) dismisses her feelings as the wild imaginings of a bored housewife. As the years pass by children and adults have either gone missing or died under mysterious circumstances, and when the vampire begins to target Particia's kids, it is up to her to stop him, but she cannot do it alone. Enter the book club.

      <p>This was a fun read; word of warning this is not a romantic vampire book, this is not a vampire you want to date especially when you find what he looks like when he starts feeding. The vampire is described as a sort of Ted Bundy character with no connections, but he is so charismatic and charming that no one suspects that there's something off about him except for Patricia Campbell who draws upon the true crime books she has read to put the pieces together. Patricia's story, however, is not a walk in the park, she has moments of self-doubt, she makes mistakes, and there's even a moment where she hits rock bottom. This is mainly due to the pressures that the upper-middle class society she lives in puts upon her. Constantly she feels pressure to be a good, supportive wife and mother even though her kids don't always appreciate her and her husband is often absent and doesn't respect her. This story is about a woman navigating a society that has yet to see value in women (and this set in the 1990s). This is also a story about how race and class play into the relationships that people form, and how people from less affluent backgrounds are often ignored when there is a crisis. This story is funny, scary, atmospheric, and quite gory; read or listen to it you will not be disappointed.
