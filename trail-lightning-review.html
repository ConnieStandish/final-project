        <p>Trail of Lightning takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where climate change and political upheavals have decimated what was once the United States. Dinetah (formerly the Navajo Reservation) is one of the few societies left standing. After the calamity gods and heroes have shown up in the human world along with the monsters of Navajo legends. Maggie Hoskie, is a supernaturally gifted monster hunter with a dark past trained by a hero of her tribe's lore. When she gets called in to search for a missing girl taken by a monster, Maggie realizes these monsters are far more complex and terrifying than she could imagine. In order to eliminate them she has to face her past.

        <p>The world building in this book was absolutely superb, I could not put it down. Although the tortured heroine trope is a bit cliche, Maggie is an intriguing protagonist, and the action sequences are well rendered. I also liked the chemistry between her and Kai Arviso, an unconventional medicine man who is more than what he seems. This is the first part in the Sixth World series and it was a great start, I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
