        <h3 class="author">Rebecca Roanhorse</h3>
        <p>Trail of Lightning takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where climate change and political upheavals have decimated what was once the United States. Dinetah (formerly the Navajo Reservation) is one of the few societies left standing, and with the calamity that befell the nation gods and heroes have appeared along with the monsters. Maggie Hoskie, a supernaturally gifted monster hunter with a dark past. At the start of the book she gets called to search for a missing girl taken by a monster, but what Maggie learns about the monster is far more terrifying than she could imagine, and in order to eliminate these monsters she has to face her past.
        </p>
        <p>The world building in this book was absolutely superb, I could not put it down. Although the tortured  heroine is a bit of an overused trope, Maggie is an intriguing protagonist, and the action sequences are well rendered. I also liked the chemistry between her and Kai Arviso, an unconventional medicine man who is more than what he  seems. This is the first part in the Sixth World series and it was a great start, I'm looking forward to reading the second part.
