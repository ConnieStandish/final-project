        <h2 class="title">Victor LaValle's Destroyer</h2>
        <h3 class="author">Victor LaValle</h3>
        <p>More than a Frankenstein retelling set in present day America, this graphic novel is a parable on race and policing in America, the boundary between scientific progress and ethics, and the lengths a person will go when driven by grief and pessimism.  The story starts when Frankenstein’s monster makes his way from the Arctic to the U.S. mainland leaving dead bodies in his wake. No longer concerned with concerning himself with the need for compassion from his creator, the creation has become The Destroyer bent on exterminating humanity. Meanwhile, Dr. Josephine Baker, using nanotechnology, has successfully resurrected her 12-year-old son Akai who was killed by a police officer while walking home from a baseball game. Despite reluctance from son, Dr. Baker is bent on getting revenge  on a system in society that has long held her to different standards compared to her white peers, and that has ultimately killed her son. When Frankenstein’s monster and the Bakers finally cross paths it becomes a showdown.
        </p>
        <p>In the author’s note, Victor LaValle mentioned that America has seen many technological advancements at an ever-increasing pace, but the pace of honest conversation, reckoning, and actual change moves at a much slower pace in the United States. This is a heartbreaking tale of a teenager who became another statistic in a police involved shooting, and a mother who was driven mad by grief and rage. The story, however, ends on a rather hopeful note when Akai refuses to give into rage and despair. LaValle mentioned that Akai embodies the best of what humanity has to offer, and that as long as there’s more kids like him humanity has a chance. The trick is to make sure they are kept alive and well.
