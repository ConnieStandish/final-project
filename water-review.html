      <h2>The Water Dancer</h2>
      <h2>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h2>
    </div>
      <p>Ta-Nehihi Coates first novel is a historical fantasy set in 1860s America. The story follows Hiram Walker, a young man born into slavery whose mother was sold away when he was a child. Hiram has two gifts. One is an ability to recall everything that he has heard, seen, or read; however, the one thing he cannot remember is his mother. The other is his ability to transport himself and others through bodies of water, which later on catches the attention of the Underground Railroad and would make him a valuable asset, if he learns how to control his gift, as he later finds out that this gift is tied to his supressed memories. This is a beautifully written novel about the horrors of slavery. Coates not only explores the pscychology of the enslaved and the slavers, but also the human condition particularly the pain and anguish of being forcefully separated from loved ones and the power of memories. Were the complexities of the agents involved in the Underground Railroad,  particularly the white abolitionists who seemed to have a fanatical drive to overturn the system of slavery that far outweighed the need to help those in bondage.

      <p>This was a beautifully written novel, but its moments of introspection also made it a hard novel. There were moments where I had to force  myself to finish it, because I wasn't sure where it was going. Once Hiram gains his memories, however, it does lead up to a hopeful conclusion. I am wondering if maybe this novel would have worked better as a historical fiction, without the magical elements, as those elements were only secondary to the storyline. This story is perfect for book club meetings, it will garner great discussions.
