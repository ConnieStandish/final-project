        <h2 class="title">The Water Dancer</h2>
        <h3 class="author"> Ta-Nehisi Coates</h3>
        <p>Ta-Nehihi Coates first novel is a historical fantasy set in 1860s America. The story follows Hiram Walker, a young man born into slavery whose mother was sold away when he was a child. Hiram has two gifts: a photographic memory and an ability to transport himself and others through bodies of water (which is referred as conduction). Hiram can recall everything that he has seen, heard, or read, but the one thing he cannot remember is his mother, and his other ability, which later catches the attention of the Underground Railroad, is tied to his supressed memories. Hiram later becomes an agent for the Underground Railroad, although the leaders believe that Hiram with his gift of conduction could be a valuable asset to the cause if only he could control his powers. This is a beautifully written novel about the horrors of slavery. Coates not only explores the pscychology of the enslaved and the slavers, but also the pain and anguish of being forcefully separated from loved ones, and the power of stories and memories. What I also found interesting were the dynamics of the agents involved in the Underground Railroad,  particularly the white abolitionists who seemed to have a fanatical drive to overturn the system of slavery that far outweighs the need to help free people in bondage.
        </p>
        <p>This was a beautifully written novel, but its moments of introspection also made it a hard novel. There were moments where I had to force  myself to finish it, because I wasn't sure where it was going. Once Hiram gains his memories, however, it leads up to a hopeful conclusion. This story probably would have worked better a historical fiction without the magical elements. It seemed that the magical elements were only secondary in the story overall, but maybe that was the point (I'm not entirely sure). This story is perfect for book club meetings, it will garner great discussions.
